## Mocap Unleashed: Harnessing the Power of 8 Parallel 10GigE Cameras
Mocap Unleashed stands as a markerless motion capture solution, leveraging RGB-based cameras and cutting-edge deep-learning algorithms to deliver real-time motion capture results. Our system processes data from 8 parallel GigE cameras. This data is then meticulously handled by powerful GPUs. The substantial computational load demands high-end resources.

The hardware specifications of AR 51's Mocap Unleashed system have undergone rigorous testing. It's crucial to emphasize that any compromise in the quality of components could significantly impair the system's performance and speed.


## PC Specification + A network Switch
Make sure the **motherboard can support an Nvidia GPU and either has a free PCIe slot for an 10G ethernet card or an extra 10G network port**:

| Component            | Example Type                            | Information                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                  | Intel i7-13700F (or similar)            | The CPU should have enough lanes to handle network cards and GPU data transfer. |
| Motherboard          | | Requirements:<br> - PCI-e 4 that can handle RTX 4070 <br> - Alternative 1: 1x PCI-e  slots for 10Gige Ethernet extension cards (**PCIe3 x 4 mode**) <br> - Alternative 2: A motherboard with an extra 10G port. | 
| Memory (RAM)         | DDR5 64G (32x2) 5200 Corsair            | Minimum speed: 4000                                                                                              |
| Storage (HDD)        | SSD 1.0TB<br>512GB should also suffice. |                                                                                                                 |
| GPU - NVidia RTX4070 | Gigabyte RTX 4070                       | Any RTX 4070 will do. Make sure the board has room for the 10-Gige Ethernet card.                                |
| 10Gige PCI-e Network card  | [TPlink - 10Gige card](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-TX401-Ethernet-Supports-Including/dp/B08D71PVXG)                   | For computers with fast USB (Thunderbolt or USB3.2 Gen2), a USB-to-10Gige connector can be used instead of the PCI network adapter.|
| Network Switch       | [Netgear MS510TXPP](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Multi-Gigabit-Managed-Uplinks-MS510TXPP/dp/B075Q5T7NH?th=1) | The switch should have **8 1Gige connection and an uplink of 10Gige** to the PC. The camera port should also be sfp+ to provide **POE** (power-over-ethernet). |

## 3 Alternatives to connect the computer to a 10Gige switch
The PC requires a 10Gige network connection. This can addressed using several methods:
1. Use a **PCI-e network 10 Gige extention card**.
2. Ensure that the motherboard has dual network: a **10 Gige connection ethernet connection** (used for the switch) and **another ethernet connection** (for the internet)
3. For computers equipped with high-speed USB interfaces like **Thunderbolt or USB 3.2 Gen2**, consider using a **USB-to-10GigE adapter**, [such as this](https://www.sonnettech.com/product/solo10g-tb3/overview.html), as an alternative to the PCI-e network adapter.
