## Calibration Sphere
The sphere used for calibration is usually a ball of light or 30CM diameter [Link to a verified supplier](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Trango-Garden-Diameter-Outdoor-Lighting/dp/B00J1OL9IS/ref=sr_1_12?crid=2IMCIF6JZFXY6&keywords=gartenleuchte+kugel+40+cm&qid=1674556426&sprefix=garden+light+ball+40+cm%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-12).

When covering large areas a bigger sphere can also be used.

## Light Bulb
The sphere should emit **a strong white light** at least 1800 Lumen [bulb example](https://www.amazon.com/Listed-6-Pack-100-Replacement-Daylight/dp/B0C9TYD7Y4?th=1).
