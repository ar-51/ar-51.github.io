## Goal

The goal of the steps below is to configure the switch to split each 100G interface into 4 interface each capbable of 25G. 
This way, the switch can work well with the existing 4 X 25G sfp pcie cards.

## Steps Before Using the Switch

### Step 1: Connect the Breakout Cable

- Connect one end of the **breakout cable** to the switch **100G port**.
- The other end should connect to the PC, split between the PCIe network cards.
- Each network card should have **two cables** connected.

### Step 2: Connect a Laptop for Configuration

- Use an **ethernet cable** to connect your laptop directly to the switch.
- The switch has a port marked **MGT (management)**. Connect the cable there and to your laptop.
- Once configuration is done, this cable can be disconnected.

### Step 3: Set Laptop IP Address

- By default, the switch uses IP **192.168.1.1**.
- Set your laptop LAN IP to the same range (e.g., **192.168.1.10**).

### Step 4: Access the Web Management Interface

- Open a browser and navigate to **192.168.1.1**.
- You should see the **web-based management system** of the switch.

### Step 5: Login to Web Interface

- Use the following credentials:
  - **User:** admin
  - **Password:** admin

## Switch Configuration via Terminal

### Step 6: Open a Terminal

- On your **laptop**, open **PuTTY** (or another SSH client).
- Connect to the switch:
  ```bash
  ssh admin@192.168.1.1
  ```
- Password: **admin**

### Step 7: Split the 100G Interfaces

- The switch has two **100G interfaces**.
- We need to split each into **4 Ã— 25G** for use with the breakout cable.

Run the following commands:

```bash
configure terminal
split interface eth-0-25 25G
split interface eth-0-26 25G
exit
write memory
reload
```

- Press **Enter** to confirm the reboot.

## Summary

At the end of this process, you should have the 100G interface splitted into 4 interfaces.
