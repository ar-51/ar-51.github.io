AR 51 provides flexible and precise control over which character blueprint is assigned to each tracked person in the system. This guide is specific to the **Unreal SDK** and is intended for developers and creators integrating AR 51 into Unreal Engine environments.

---

## Overview

When a new person is detected in the capture area, AR 51 automatically determines which character should be assigned. This logic is handled internally and follows a priority-based decision tree:

1. **Active Person Override** (typically the person wearing the local headset in VR)
2. **Character from Skeleton Data** (`characterprefab` field shared across devices)
3. **EntityId to Character Mapping** (persistent, privacy-safe identity)
4. **PersonId to Character Mapping** (temporary per-session identity)
5. **Auto Assignment Mode** fallback

## VR & Multi-User Character Sync

In VR setups, the **Active Person** is automatically identified as the user closest to the headset.

- If a local user selects a character (e.g., "CharacterA"), this is shared with the AR 51 server.
- Other connected devices (e.g., additional headsets or Unity clients) receive this info and display that person as "CharacterA".
- If another headset selects "CharacterB" later, both users will see each other correctly across all systems.

This ensures **consistent character representation across all clients**, even in multiplayer or cross-platform setups.

:::info  What is the Active Person?
The **Active Person** is the person currently wearing the VR headset tracked by the local system. This person is automatically detected by proximity to the camera or anchor.

In multi-user VR scenarios, each device identifies its own Active Person and selects a character for them. This selection is then propagated to all connected devices via the `characterprefab` field in the skeleton data, ensuring synchronized identity and visual representation.

## Understanding EntityId vs PersonId

| Identifier  | Purpose                                | Lifespan                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `PersonId`  | Temporary session ID (a.k.a. SkeletonId) | Valid only while the person is tracked |
| `EntityId`  | Persistent ID assigned to recurring people | Survives across sessions, device-safe |

AR 51 can identify people after just a few seconds in the capture space, assigning them an `EntityId`. When they return in the future, they are recognized and assigned the same ID â€” enabling persistent identity **without storing personal information**.

## Auto Character Assignment Mode

When no explicit mapping is found, the **Auto Assignment Mode** determines which character to assign:

- **Default**: Uses the first valid blueprint in the `CharacterBlueprints` list.
- **Cycle**: Assigns characters sequentially for variety.
- **Random**: Picks a character randomly from the list.

## Assigning Characters

### Using the Details Panel (Editor Setup)

You can map specific characters to people or entities using the following editable fields:

- **Person Id to Character BP Map**: Maps temporary session IDs.
- **Entity Id to Character BP Map**: Maps persistent identities.

### Using Blueprints (Runtime Control)

You can assign characters dynamically using Blueprint logic:

```blueprint
GetSingletone()->SetActiveCharacter("CharacterName");
GetSkeletonConsumerInstance()->SetCharacterByPersonId("PersonId123", "CharacterName");
GetSkeletonConsumerInstance()->SetCharacterByEntityId("EntityId456", "CharacterName");
```

These are exposed as `BlueprintCallable` methods and can be used in UI, initialization flows, or live triggers.

### Access via C++ (Advanced)

If you're working in C++, you can use the static singleton accessor:

```cpp
USkeletonConsumer::Instance()->SetCharacterByEntityId("entity_123", "MyCharacterBP");
```

Or directly modify the maps:

```cpp
USkeletonConsumer::Instance()->PersonIdToCharacterBPMap.Add("temp_123", "MyCharacterBP");
```
