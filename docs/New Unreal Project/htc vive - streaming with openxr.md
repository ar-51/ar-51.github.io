## Try to deploy a simple level to your headset

Try and build the project and deploy it to your headset.

## Download and extract AR51 Unreal-SDK Plugin and AR51 OpenXR Plugins into the Plugins folder
Your plugins folder should look like this ![plugin_folder](/assets/images/unreal_plugin_folder_openXR.png)

Restart the editor to enable the plugins.

## Create a new level
File -> New Level -> Basic

## Be sure to set the visibility of the plugins to True
In the Content Browser window. Select settings and enable "Show Plugin Content"

## Drag the AR51 SDK Blueprint into the current level
From the "Content Browser" windows, select Plugins -> AR51 SDK Content -> Blueprints and drag "AR51SDK_Blueprint" into the level. 

## Drag the AR51 OpenXR-related Blueprints into the current level
From the "Content Browser" windows, select Plugins -> AR51SDK_OPENXR Content -> Blueprints and drag: **"VRPawn"**, **"OpenXrBoundary Adapter_BP"** and **"OpenXrHands Adapter_BP"** into the level. 

## Make sure your VrPawn object uses "stage tracking"
Either create a new VRPawn object (using [these instructions](https://hub.vive.com/storage/docs/en-us/UnrealPlugin/VRPawn.html)) or edit the provided VRPawn Blueprint.
Make sure that your tracking space is set to “Stage” ![tracking_set_to_stage](/assets/images/unreal_vrpawn_tracking_origin_set_to_stage.png)

If you do not set the tracking mode to “Stage”, the skeleton will not appear on your body once you restart the VR application.
{: .warning }

## In AR51 Blueprint, select "HtcVive" as the platform type
From the Details panel, under “General”, you should see the "Platform" field. Please select "HTC Vive"  ![select_platform_type](/assets/images/unreal_select_plaform_type_wave.png)

## In a tethered deployment - enable "Start in VR"
Before deploying to a tethered application (PC VR app), be sure that you project is set to start in VR.
In Unreal-Engine, under "Project Settings" -> "Project Description" enable "Start in VR".

![enable_start_in_VR](/assets/images/unreal_engine_start_in_VR.png)


## Hit Play 
Make sure that AR51's system is running on the same local network as your device.
{: .warning }

You should see the character move in realtime ![character_waving](/assets/images/unreal_character_waving.png).

## On your first run, perform device calibration
You should now perform [device calibration]({% link docs/System Calibration/Device_calibration.md %})  so that the character would position on your body.
